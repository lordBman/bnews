Remember his roof-of-the-net banger in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Liverpool? The central defender was at it again here and if there was a slice of luck about his late winner, one to blow open a previously dismal spectacle, it did nothing to dampen the celebrations. There is a case to be made as Amorim feels his way into the Impossible Job at Old Trafford, encountering so many problems, that his team is shaping up OK away from home. Uniteds best performances under him have been at the grounds of their biggest rivals: Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City.",
